# Hands-Free-Keyboard
##Overview
The Hands-Free Keyboard is a platform for hands-free typing via the use of an eye tracker or head tracker. The keyboard functionality has been specifically tuned for use with eye trackers and head trackers, specifically in the case of users who have extremely limited mobility due to conditions such as ALS.

Integration with eye trackers and head trackers is supported via the GazePointer SDK. For information on what trackers are supported, how to add support for new trackers, and to modify underlying filtering algorithms please refer to the GazePointer SDK repository.

The Hands-Free Keyboard has been tested using a Surface Pro 4 pc with a Tobii PCEye Mini eye tracker. Additionally, mouse emulation is provided for those who want to experiment but don't yet have an eye tracker.
