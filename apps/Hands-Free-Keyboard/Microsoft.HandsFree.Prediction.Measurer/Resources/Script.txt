Oh, you wicked little thing!
Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners!
You OUGHT, Dinah, you know you ought!
Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?
You'd have guessed if you'd been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn't.
I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty!
Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off.
We'll go and see the bonfire tomorrow.
Do you know, I was so angry, when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow!
And you'd have deserved it!
What have you got to say for yourself?
Now don't interrupt me!
I'm going to tell you all your faults.
Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning.
Now you can't deny it: I heard you!
What's that you say?
Her paw went into your eye?
Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open--if you'd shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened.
Now don't make any more excuses!
Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her!
What, you were thirsty, were you?
How do you know she wasn't thirsty too?
Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't looking!
That's three faults, Kitty, and you've not been punished for any of them yet.
You know I'm saving up all your punishments for next Wednesday.
Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments!
What WOULD they do at the end of a year?
I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came.
Or--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once!
Well, I shouldn't mind THAT!
I'd far rather go without them than eat them!
