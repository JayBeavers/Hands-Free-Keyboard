## [Microsoft Hands-Free Keyboard](https://msrenable.blob.core.windows.net/install/EnablingTech-production/latest/Microsoft.HandsFree.Keyboard/Setup.exe)

Microsoft Hands-Free Keyboard enables a user to type with their eyes and speak using their computer.  The application predicts letters, words, and phrases based on context and past typed entries to improve the speed of communication.


### Application Requirements

These applications are designed for use on the [Microsoft Surface Pro 3](https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-Pro-3/productID.300190600) with a [Tobii EyeX device](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/eyex/).  You must download and install the [Tobii EyeX Engine](http://developer.tobii.com/eyex-setup/).

These applications will work on other Windows x64 based computers but they are optimized for the screen size of the Surface Pro 3.

The applications are tested on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted

These applications collect email address for user identification and contact purposes. These applications also use analytics tools, which are enabled by default, to gather usage and performance data such as screens visited, duration of use, and performance. This information is sent to Microsoft to assist with application support and guidance.

Microsoft Hands-Free Keyboard also collects typed entries by default in order to create a customized database for a user.  This data collection can be disabled via a privacy button on the application.
Collected input is stored in a secure database or on the user’s device.

### Use of Information

The collected identifiable information will be used to maintain contact with users for guidance and feedback. Typed entries are used to create a customized database for a user, enabling predictive letter, word and phrase selection. Collected analytics are used to analyze usage and improve the application.

### Choice/Control

The “in private” keyboard button can be activated any time by the user to stop user-typed entries from going into the local dictionary that is used to make predictions of the user’s typing. If you choose not to participate in the collection of typed data, you can click the privacy button in the application window to turn off recording.  If you choose not to participate in the analytics data you can uninstall this application.
